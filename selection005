#Ask the user if it is raining and convert their answer to lower case (help? Go to
#http://www.gcsecs.com/methods.html) so it doesn’t matter that what cased they type in.
#If they answer “yes”, ask if it is windy. If they answer “yes” to this second question,
#display the answer “it is too windy for an umbrella”
#Otherwise
#Display the message “take an umbrella”, if they did not answer yes to the first questions,
#display the answer “Enjoy your day”.
#Hint – it is possible to put an if statement inside an if statement
